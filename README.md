# Rainfall Prediction Project

This is a machine learning project to predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on various weather features.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `rainfall_prediction.py` → Main Python script to train and test models (Logistic Regression & Random Forest).
- `rainfall.csv` → Dataset used for training and testing.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (sklearn)

## 📈 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. Load and clean the dataset
2. Preprocess features
3. Train two models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest)
4. Evaluate models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone this repository:

https://github.com/Ayu-shhh17/rainfall-prediction.git


2. Install required libraries:

pip install pandas
            numpy 
            matplotlib
            seaborn
            scikit-learn
3. pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the script:

rainfall_prediction.py


## 🔥 Output Example
